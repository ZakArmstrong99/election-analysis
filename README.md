# election-analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:
The purpose of this analysis is to write python code in order to print election results of three counties and
candidates, along with the winner. The reason python code is necessary is due to the fact the results are on 
a csv file that has over 300,000 rows, and python makes it efficient to retrieve this data. Not only does 
the code retrieve the data, but does calculations that adds total vote counts for each county and candidate.
